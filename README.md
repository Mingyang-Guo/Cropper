# Cropper: Attention-Guided Ensemble Model for Crop Disease Detection 🌿

Cropper is a lightweight and interpretable deep ensemble framework for detecting crop diseases using leaf images. It integrates multiple convolutional backbones with attention mechanisms to deliver high accuracy, visual interpretability, and edge-device deployability, particularly in data-scarce agricultural environments.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔁 Multi-backbone ensemble (InceptionV3, ResNet34, EfficientNetV2-S)
- 🧠 Attention-guided feature refinement (Channel & Spatial attention)
- 🖼️ Visualization with class-discriminative attention maps
- 🌾 Supports multiple crops: rice, betel, cabbage, Chinese cabbage
- ⚙️ Includes benchmark models: PlantDet, Guava, LeafNext for comparison
- 📉 Ablation-friendly architecture and reproducible evaluation protocol

## 🧪 Datasets

The model supports **4 plant leaf datasets** (publicly available):

- **Rice**: Multi-class (6 disease types) 
- **Betel**: Binary classification (healthy vs. unhealthy)
- **Cabbage**: Binary classification (nutrient deficiency vs. healthy)
- **Chinese Cabbage**: Binary classification (Botanical Leaf Spot)

The linkings of these datasets can be found in the paper.

Dataset info and splits stats are documented in `dataset_Info.xlsx`.
